# What are compilers?
Compilers are the process that allows your human-readable code to be executable on the machine, it allows for your program to be able to run for the instructions that you have programmed with your programming language.

Compilers also are used in conjunctions with a Language Server, see ![this post](https://github.com/De-y/blog/blob/main/posts/what%20is%20an%20LSP.md).
