# Python Setup in VSCode

This post will show how you can create an environment in Python within Visual Studio Codeto be able to build bigger, better projects.

## Place to start

Start by installing Python for your operating system, located ![here](https://python.org/download).

Then what you want to do is to create a virtual environment (like npm but is confusing) utilizing the command:

``python -m venv .venv``

And then once that is created, then you will get a prompt to utilize it as the default for your workspace, which you want to click. You will then also be prompted to install extensions when you create and open a new .py file, which you should install as it provides type language support.

That's basically it.
