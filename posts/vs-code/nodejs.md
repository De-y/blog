# Setting up NodeJS & TypeScript in VSCode

First, you need to install NodeJS, located ![here](https://nodejs.org/en).

Then what you want to do is to install setup the NodeJS project by running ``npm init`` and then follow the setup instructions.

After that, you would want to get plugins, located ![here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/extensions). Then, if you would like to utilize Typescript, run ``npm install typescript ts-node`` and then create a Typescript file.

To run the Typescript file, run the command ``npx ts-node ./[file]``

That's basically it!
