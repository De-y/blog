# What are LSP's
An LSP, or known as the language server protocol, is an open source standard for communicating between a client, and a server.

Originally developed in 2016 by Microsoft for Visual Studio, it became open source thereafter.

# What are these client and server and what do they do?

You have the client, which is the IDE, like Visual Studio Code

And then you have the server, which is the language servers, like the C++ language server, or the Python Language Server

These 2 communicate together to be able to do features like

* Syntax highlighting
* Code completion
* Highlighting problems or code errors.

Which then allows you to go ahead and fix your bad code (mine atleast)
